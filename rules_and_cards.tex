\subsection*{Summary}

The game is played between two players who build their decks and take turns playing cards from them. Their decks start weak, but they can improve them by buying better cards or removing weak ones. Each player also some mana (used to play cards), gold (used to buy cards) and HP (hit points). Some cards give gold, deal damage or restore HP, while others provide various forms of utility, shielding or buffs. Seven elemental dice determine the strengths of various cards: Fire \fire, Earth \earth, Water \water, Nature \nature, Gold \gold, Magic \magic \ and Chance \chance. They are rolled at the start and not automatically changed after that. However, some cards can change the values of these dice, changing how strong other cards are.

\subsection*{Win condition}

The game ends in one of two cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item A player's HP reaches 0 (or less). Then the other player wins. If both players' HPs reach 0 at the same time, the one whose card caused this wins.
\item A player's HP reaches 200 (or more). Then they win. (Cannot happen to both players simultaneously.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The cards}

There are some \starter \ and \draft \ cards, which each player's deck starts with. The rest are buyable from the shop and have gold costs: \onecost, \twocost, \threecost, \fourcost \ or \fivecost.

Mechanically, there are 3 types of cards:

\begin{itemize}
\item Spell -- The most common type; these cards get played from a player's hand and cost 1 mana to play (default a player only gets 1 mana per turn and, if unused, it is lost at the end of the turn).
\item Blessing -- Similar to a Spell, except that they cost no mana (so any number of them can be played per turn) and that they can also be played during the opponent's turn.
\item Relic -- These cards are deployed immediately upon being acquired and remain in play until the end of the game (i.e. they provide passive effects).
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we can classify most cards depending on what they do:

\begin{itemize}
\item Attack -- ``Deal X damage'' cards (i.e. reduce the opponent's HP). They scale with one or two of \fire, \earth, \water, \chance \ and \magic. Attacks that scale with \water \ deal damage to both players.
\item Restore -- ``Restore X HP'' cards. They scale with \nature \ and possibly one of the attack elements.
\item Gold -- ``Gain X gold'' cards. They scale with \gold \ and possibly one of the attack elements.
\item Shield -- ``Shield X against Y damage'' cards. They subtract the value of element X from that of Y to reduce incoming damage. There are shield cards against \fire, \earth \ and \water \ attacks.
\item Buff -- ``[Increase] the strength of all your X effects'' cards. They affect all cards that scale with the element X. There are Buff cards for all elements except \chance.
\item Dice Control -- various cards that affect the dice (either changing their values or rerolling them). These are the only way to change the dice values (and thus affect how strong various elemental cards are).
\item Draw -- ``Draw X cards'' cards. Useful for finding the valuable cards.
\item Mana -- ``Gain X mana'' cards. Useful for playing multiple Spells in a single turn.
\item Removal -- ``Permanently remove X cards from ...'' cards. Permanently removing a card means removing it from one's deck and moving it to the removed cards pile. Useful for removing bad cards.
\item Other utility -- various other cards with hard to categorize effects. Some may allow seeing otherwise hidden information or messing with the opponent in some way, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The \chance \ die}

Unlike all other dice, whenever its value is needed by a card, it is rerolled before executing the card.

\subsection*{Gold}

Gold (represented by the coins) is gained passively (1 per turn) and by playing cards. Other than with gold cards: A player dealing damage or restoring HP (to their opponent or themselves) receives gold equal to half the damage dealt/HP restored (rounded up). Gold is mainly spent on rerolling the shop, buying cards or placing face down cards.

\subsection*{Shields}

Shields may affect multiple attacks while deployed. Multiple shields may affect the same attack, if all apply. Preventing damage due to shielding also prevents gaining the gold the attacker would have received otherwise (since the damage was not actually dealt).

\vspace{4pt}

Shields (``Shield X against Y damage until the end of your opponent's turn.'') work by subtracting the value of element X from the value of the element Y (without going negative) in incoming damage calculations. This is done before any multiplicative scaling is applied (such as times 2 or times \magic). Note that ``Magical Barrier'' (``Shield \magic \ against \fire, \earth \ or \water \ in multi-element damage until the end of your opponent's turn.'') can target any of \fire, \earth \ or \water \ (only one per attack), but only in multi-element attacks. The choice of which to target is individual for each attack.

\subsection*{Buffs}

Buffs (``Double the strength of all your X effects until the end of your turn.'') work by doubling the (post shielding) strength of all effects that scale with their element (and possibly others). Similarly to shields, they may affect multiple cards while deployed and multiple buffs may affect the same cards.

\subsection*{Initial setup}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each player starts with \starthp \ HP (out of 200) and \startgold \ gold (use the HP tracker for the HP and the coins for the gold).
\item All seven elemental dice are rolled and ordered next to the HP tracker like so: \fire, \earth, \water, \nature, \gold, \magic, \chance.
\item All with gold costs are shuffled together and form the shop's draw pile. No shop cards are laid out at the start.
\item The 8 \draft \ cards (``Fire'', ``Tremor'', ``Heavy Rain'', ``Blind Attack'', ``Flower Gardens'', ``Marketplace'', ``Gambling'' and ``Cheap Trick'') are shuffled together; 6 of them are dealt out and the other 2 are permanently removed.
\item Each player rolls a die and whoever rolls higher choses who goes first. (In case of a tie, reroll.)
\item The player who rolled lower in the first player determination may decide to swap who goes first and who goes second by offering 1 Advantage to the other player. If this happens, the other player has the same option, but for 2 Advantage. This repeats (with increasing Advantage numbers) until one player passes up on using this option. (Only the final Advantage offer remains in effect.)
\item The first player drafts (chooses) 1 of the dealt out \draft \ cards, the second one drafts 2 of the remaining ones, the first one drafts 2, and the last card goes to the second player.
\item The starting draw pile of each player is formed by shuffling together the 9 Starter cards (8 ``Basic Income'' and 1 ``Lucky Find'') and their 3 chosen \draft \ cards.
\item The player with X Advantage (if any) may change the value of a die by 1 up to X times (may be the same die, different dice or any other combination).
\item Each player draws \handsize \ cards from their draw pile into their hand and the first player starts their turn.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{A player's turn}

At the start of their turn, the player gains 1 gold and 1 mana. After that they may do any of the following actions (in any order, possibly multiple times and/or interleaved):

\begin{itemize}
\item Play a Spell from their hand at the cost of 1 mana.
\item Play a Blessing from their hand at no cost.
\item Place a face down card at the cost of 1 mana and \facedowncost \ gold. A player may have at most \dacedownsize \ face down cards at a time.
\item Play (flip over and activate) any number of face down cards at no cost.
\item Reroll the shop. The first reroll in a turn costs \rerollcost \ gold and each subsequent is \rerollcostincrease \ gold more expensive.
Rerolling the shop consists of moving the currently laid out shop cards (if any) to the shop's discard pile followed by drawing and laying out \shopsize \ cards from the shop's draw pile. Note that initially there are no shop cards laid out.
\item Buy a card from the laid out shop cards by paying its cost. May be done at most once per turn.
The bought card is not replaced with a new card, so the shop can become empty again. The bought card goes to the player's discard pile, unless it is a Relic, in which case it is immediately and permanently deployed.
\end{itemize}

Whenever a card is played it is kept in the player's play area until its effect is fully executed. After that it is moved to the discard pile. This means that a ``Draw X'' card cannot draw itself. Cards whose effects last longer (shields and buffs) are kept in the play area until their effect expire (at which point they are moved to the discard pile). Effects that give mana (and similar) are considered as executed immediately and the card can be discarded. Use the spare dice to keep track of your mana, if needed.

\vspace{4pt}

After the player's turn is over, they lose all their mana, discard their hand to their discard pile and draw \handsize \ cards from their draw pile.

\subsection*{During the opponent's turn}

Blessings and face down cards may also be played during the opponent's turn. This can be done at any time, including between the opponent playing a card and executing its effect. In such a situation, the opponent, may in turn, also respond (possibly with multiple cards) before executing their original card. This can repeat ad infinitum. See the detailed priority rules for more information.

\vspace{4pt}

Example: During her turn, Alice plays a \fire \ attack. Then Bob plays (flips over and activates) his two face down cards: one that allows him to reroll the \fire \ die, and a \water \ shield against this attack. Alice then plays a Blessing that gives her mana, allowing her to play another Spell, after which she plays ``Trickster God'' to swap the values of the \fire \ and \water \ dice. However, Bob counters this by playing the Blessing ``Veto'' from his hand, thus canceling the effect of ``Trickster God''. Finally, Alice's attack is executed and Bob's shield negates all damage.

\subsection*{Discard pile}

Whenever a player needs to discard some number of cards (from their hand or face down cards) but has fewer than that, they simply discard all such cards and that effect is considered as exectuted. Whenever a card needs to be drawn from a deck's draw pile, but it is empty, its discard pile is shuffled and it becomes the draw pile. This is never triggered by inspection (``Look at top X cards of Y'') effects, even if the draw pile has fewer than X cards.

\subsection*{Private and public information}

A player's hand, face down cards, discard pile, discards and card removals are private information, i.e. they may see them, but the other player cannot. The contents and order of their draw pile and the removed cards pile are hidden information, i.e. nobody can see them. Gold, HP, mana and all counts (i.e. number of discarded cards, removed cards, face down cards, cards in a player's hand, draw pile or discard pile, or the removed cards pile) are all public information, i.e. both players can see them.

\subsection*{Detailed priority rules}

The details will rarely matter, but this section makes it precise whose ``turn'' it is to act in all situations. At any time one player has ``priority'', i.e. they may act, if they choose. If they chose not to, the priority may transfer to the other player or it may not (depending on the priority state). There is also a stack of cards/effects to be executed (which may be in the middle of execution).

\vspace{4pt}

When a player plays a card its effects (e.g. 1. do X, 2. draw cards) are added to the stack. They are then executed in a row and the card is discarded when the last one is executed. Playing the card and each subsequent effect execution gives priority to the other player.

\vspace{4pt}

If an effect reveals some new information or options to the player whose card caused it (e.g. seeing cards, drawing, a die roll), the priority returns to them, if the other player choses not to use it. This also happens upon full execution of a card's effects. This is ``returning priority''.

\vspace{4pt}

Returning priority is also given to the other player after any of the other types of actions (e.g. placing a face down card, shop rolling, buying a card) and at the start of a player's turn (i.e. the other player has priority first).

\subsection*{Clarifications}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Wish'' (``Buy any unowned card in the game for free, then shuffle the shop's draw pile.'') can target the shop and its draw and discard piles. The chosen card is private information.
\item Cards such as ``Gambling'', ``Cheap Trick'', ``Second Chance'', ``Sleight of Hand'', ``Calculated Risk'', ``Smoke and Mirrors'' and ``Perspective Shift'' affect only one die (chosen by the player), i.e. their effect cannot be split up over multiple dice.
\item ``At What Cost'' (``Permanently remove a Relic you own upon buying this; gain 1 extra mana at the start of your turn.'') cannot be bought, if the player does not own another Relic card.
\item ``Veto'' (``Cancel a not yet executed card of your opponent.'') can be played without any possible target, but then it does nothing. Cannot target Relics.
\item ``Madness'' (``Upon buying this reroll all dice and permanently remove this card.'') counts as being played for the purposes of other cards (e.g. could be canceled by ``Veto''). 
\item ``Magnetic Hands'' (``Move any card from your draw or discard pile to your hand, then shuffle your draw pile.'') does not count as being a draw for the purposes of ``Exploration ...'' cards.
