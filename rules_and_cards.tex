\title{Rules and Cards for Elemental Deck Builder}
\author{Emil Indzhev}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

\item

The game is played between two players who take turns. The player whose HP reaches 0 first loses. If both players' HPs reach 0 at the same time, the one whose action caused this wins.

\item

Seven dice determine the strengths of various cards: fire \fire, earth \earth, water \water, nature \nature, magic \magic, gold \gold \ and chance \chance. They are rolled at the start of the game. The last one is also rerolled whenever its value is needed (possibly multiple times per turn). Various cards can change their values.

\item

Each starts with 60 HP, 6 gold and 8 Basic Income cards in their draw pile.

\item

All non-starter cards are shuffled into a shop deck. Initially, there is no shop laid out. When a player re-rolls the shop, which costs \rerollcost gold, the current laid out shop is moved to the shop's discard pile and \shopsize cards are drawn from the shop's draw pile. When a card is bought by a player, by paying its cost, it is not automatically replaced with a new card.

\item

On each turn a player may (in any order): gain one gold, play at most one action from their hand, play any number of blessings from their hand, play any number of face down actions, re-roll the shop at most twice, buy at most one card from the shop. Playing an action from one's hand, consists of either playing it now or placing it face down, which costs \facedowncost gold. A played card, after its effect is executed, goes to the player's discard pile. After a player's turn is over, they have to discard their hand and draw \handsize cards from their draw pile (this is also done at the start of the game). A player may have at most 2 face down actions at a time.

\item

Whenever a card needs to be drawn from a deck's draw pile, but it is empty. Its discard pile is shuffled and it becomes the draw pile.

\item

Blessings and face down actions may also be played during the opponent's turn. This can be done at any time, including between the opponent playing a card and executing its action. In such a situation, the player whose turn it is, may in turn, also respond before executing their original action. This can repeat ad infinitum.

\item

A player dealing damage (to their opponent or themselves) receives gold equal to the damage dealt.
