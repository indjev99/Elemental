\title{Elemental Dice}

\maketitle

\subsubsection*{Summary}

The game is played between two players who build their decks and take turns playing cards from them. Other than their deck, at any point, each player has some amount of gold and some amount of HP (hit points). Each player's deck starts weak, but they can improve it by buying better cards or removing weak ones. Some cards provide various forms of utility or buffs, while others give gold, deal damage (which also gives gold) or give HP. Seven elemental dice determine the strengths of various cards: fire \fire, earth \earth, water \water, gold \gold, nature \nature, magic \magic \ and chance \chance. Some cards can change the values of these dice, thus changing how strong other cards are.

\subsubsection*{Win condition}

The game ends in one of two cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item A player's HP reaches 0 (or less). Then the other player wins. If both players' HPs reach 0 at the same time, the one whose action caused this wins.
\item A player's HP reaches 200 (or more). Then they win. (Cannot happen to both players simultaneously.)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Initial setup}

\begin{itemize}
\item All seven elemental dice are rolled and ordered next to the HP tracker like so: \fire, \earth, \water, \gold, \nature, \magic, \chance.
\item Each player starts with 100 HP and 9 gold (use the HP tracker for the HP and the coins for the gold).
\item The starting deck of each player consists of 9 ``Basic Income'' cards and 1 ``Lucky Find'' card, which get shuffled together and form the player's draw pile.
\item All other cards are shuffled together and form the shop's draw pile.
\item Each player draws \handsize \ cards from their draw pile into their hand.
\item Each player rolls a die and whoever rolls higher choses who goes first. (In case of a tie, reroll.)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{The cards}

All non-starter cards cost: \onecost \ gold, \twocost \ gold, \threecost \ gold, \fourcost \ gold or \fivecost \ gold. There are 3 types of cards:

\begin{itemize}
\item Action -- The most common type, these get played from a player's hand and by default a player can only play one of them per turn.
\item Blessing -- Similar to an action, except that any number of them can be played per turn (they can also be played during the opponent's turn).
\item Passive -- These cards are deployed immediately upon being acquired and remain in play until the end of the game.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{The elements}

All 7 elements have a die associated with them. Various elemental cards scale with the values of one or more of these dice. These values mostly remain constant, until changed by some card.

\begin{itemize}
\item \fire, \earth, \water, \chance \ -- All attack (``Deal X damage'') cards scale with one or two of these elements (and possibly \magic). Dealing damage also gives gold. There are shield cards against the first 3 of these elements.
\item \water \ -- All attacks that scale with \water \ deal damage to both players.
\item \gold \ -- All gold (``Gain X gold'') cards scale with \gold. Cheaper than attack cards with equivalent scaling.
\item \nature \ -- All heal (``Gain X HP'') cards scale with \nature. Gaining HP also gives gold. Cheaper than attack cards with equivalent scaling.
\item \magic \ -- A multiplicative scaler in some attacks, gold cards, and heal cards.
\item \chance \ -- Whenever its value is needed for some effect, its die is rerolled before calculating the effect's strength. Cards that affect the dice cannot affect it (unless explicitly stated otherwise.)
\end{itemize}

There are also buff (``Double the strength of all your X effects'') for all elements except \chance.

\subsubsection*{A player's turn}

At the start of their turn, the player gains 1 gold. After that they may (in any order, possibly interleaved):

\begin{itemize}
\item Play at most one action from their hand (some cards may allow playing multiple actions).
\item Play any number of blessings from their hand.
\item Instead of playing an action, place a face down card, which also costs 5 gold. A player may have at most \dacedownsize \ face down cards at a time.
\item Play (flip over and activate) any number of face down cards.
\item Reroll the shop at most twice, which costs 2 gold per reroll.
Rerolling the shop consists of moving the current laid out shop to the shop's discard pile followed by drawing and laying our \shopsize \ cards from the shop's draw pile. Note that initially there is no shop laid out.
\item Buy at most one card from the shop by paying its cost. It is not replaced with a new card, so the shop can become empty again. The bought card goes to the player's discard pile, unless it is a passive, in which case it is immediately and permanently deployed.
\end{itemize}

Whenever a card is played it is kept in the player's play area until its effect is fully executed, after that it is moved to the discard pile. This means that a ``Draw X'' card cannot draw itself. Cards whose effects last longer (shields and buffs) are kept in the play area until their effect runs outs (at which point they are moved to the discard pile). Effects that allow playing extra actions are considered as executed immediately and the card can be discarded. Use the spare dice to keep track of the number of allowed actions.

After the player's turn is over, they have to discard their hand to their discard pile and draw \handsize \ cards from their draw pile. 

\subsubsection*{During the opponent's turn}

Blessings and face down cards may also be played during the opponent's turn. This can be done at any time, including between the opponent playing a card and executing its effect. In such a situation, the opponent, may in turn, also respond (possibly with multiple cards) before executing their original action. This can repeat ad infinitum.

For example: It is Alice's turn and she plays a \fire \ attack. Then, Bob plays a blessing (from his hand) that allows him to see Alice's hand. After that he plays (flips over and activates) two of his face down cards: first, a card that allows him to reroll the \fire \ die; second, a \water \ shield agains this attack. Alice wants to counter the shield, so she plays a blessing that allows her to play another action, after which she plays ``Veto'', which cancels Bob's shield.

\subsubsection*{Gold}

Gain (represented by the coins) is gained passively (1 per turn) and by playing gold cards, attacks or heal cards. A player dealing damage (to their opponent or themselves) receives gold equal to the damage dealt (cards that say ``Lose X HP'' do not give gold). A player gaining HP receives gold equal to half the HP gained (rounded up). Gold is mainly spent on rerolling the shop, buying cards from it or placing face down cards.

\subsection*{Reshuffling}

Whenever a card needs to be drawn from a deck's draw pile, but it is empty, its discard pile is shuffled and it becomes the draw pile. This is not triggered by inspection (``Look at top X cards of Y'') cards, even if the deck has fewer than X cards in it (or even 0).

\subsection*{Shields}

Shields may affect multiple attacks while deployed. Multiple shields may affect the same attack, if all apply. Preventing damage due to shielding also prevents gaining the gold the attacker would have received otherwise (since the damage was not actually dealt).

Elemental shields work by subtracting the value of the element they scale with from the value of the element they target (without going negative), this is done before any scaling calculations (such as times 2 or times \magic). Note that ``Magical Barrier'' (``Shield \magic \ against \fire, \earth \ or \water \ in multi-element damage until the end of your opponent's turn.'') can target any of \fire, \earth \ or \water \ (only one per attack), but only in multi-element attacks. The choice of which to target is individual for each attack.

Unlike all of these, ``Paid Militia'' (``Shield any damage by paying one gold per damage until the end of your opponent's turn.'') is applied to the final damage number, since it does not scale with or target particular elements. Preventing the damage (and paying the cost) is optional.

\subsection*{Buffs}

Elemental buffs work similarly to shields in that they may affect multiple cards while deployed. Also similarly, they double the effective value of their respective elements prior to any scaling calculations.

\subsection*{Clarifications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Players' discards (and discard piles) are face down and are private information, as are any permanently removed cards or the card chosen with ``Wish'' (``Buy any unowned card in the game for free, then shuffle the shop's draw pile.''). Gold, HP and discard and draw pile sizes are public information.
\item Permanently removing a card means removing it from your deck and returning it to the game box. Removed cards can still be targeted by ``Wish'' (i.e. can be inspected upon playing it). 
\item Whenever a player needs to discard some number of cards (from their hand or face down cards) but has fewer than that, they simply discard all such cards and that effect is considered as exectuted.
\item Cards such as ``Gambling'', ``Cheap Trick'', ``Second Chance'', ``Sleight of Hand'', ``Calculated Risk'', ``Smoke and Mirrors'' and ``Perspective Shift'' affect only one die (chosen by the player), i.e. their effect cannot be split up over multiple dice.
\item ``At What Cost'' (``Permanently remove a passive you own upon buying this; play up to 1 extra action per turn.'') cannot be bought, if the player does not own another passive card.
\item ``Veto'' (``Cancel the last action or blessing of your opponent and permanently remove this card.'') can only be played as a response to another active card (action or blessing) by the opponent.
\item ``Madness'' (``Upon buying this reroll all dice (including \chance) and permanently remove this card.'') counts as being played for the purposes of other cards (e.g. could be canceled by ``Veto''). 
\item Do not take too long (no longer than 1-2 minutes, as agreed) for cards such as ``Well-Laid Plans'' (``Reorder your draw pile.'') and ``Sabotage'' (``Reorder your opponent's draw pile.'').
\end{itemize}
