\title{Rules and Cards for Elemental Card-Dice Game}
\author{Emil Indzhev}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

\item

The game is played between two players who take turns. The player whose health reaches zero first loses and the other wins.

\item

Seven dice are rolled at the start of the game. Those are the fire \fire, earth \earth, water \water, nature \nature, magic \magic, gold \gold \ and utility \utility \ dice. These dice determine the strengths of various cards.

\item

Players start with 100 health, 6 gold, 5 Basic Income cards in their deck and no cards in their hand.

\item

All other cards are shuffled into two decks: cheap (costing \onecost \ or \twocost \ gold) and expensive (costing \threecost \ or \fourcost \ gold). Four cards are dealt from each deck. Those are the shops from which cards can be purchased. At the end of a player's turn, the oldest card in each of the two card shops is removed. Then both shops are refilled back to four cards from their respective decks. The removed cards are set aside. When a shop's deck is empty but a card must be drawn from it, the pile of removed cards is shuffled and added to the shop's deck.

\item

On each turn a player may do the following in any order: gain one gold, draw one card, discard any number of cards, play one action, play any number of blessings and/or bid for one card. When a player must draw but their deck is empty, their discard pile is shuffled and then added to their deck. The player must end their turn with at most 5 cards in their hand.

\item

Playing an action consists of either executing it or placing it face down on the table for a later turn. Executing it later isn't counted towards that turn's action limit but requires paying its cost.

\item

A player may respond to their opponent's action by playing an action which affects (or may affect) its result; the response is executed before the action that triggered it. This requires paying the cost of the action but does not count towards the player's action limit on their next turn. The action may either come from the player's hand or their face down actions. The opponent is then allowed to play further actions and/or blessings before executing the original action that triggered the response. In the case of actions, the player may respond to them as well.

\item

Bidding for a card consists of a player announcing their interest in buying a card from one of the shops for its stated cost. Then their opponent may outbid them to two times that. The player may then match their opponent's bid. This bidding in multiples of the stated cost continues until either the opponent doesn't outbid or the player doesn't match. The player is allowed to play actions during the auction. Its winner gets the card. If it is a passive card, it is immediately activated for the rest of the game. Otherwise, it is added to the player's discard pile.

\item

A player dealing damage (to their opponent or themselves) receives gold equal to the damage dealt.

\item

All fractional number amounts are always rounded up before execution.
